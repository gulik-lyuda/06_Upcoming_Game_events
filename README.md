Single Page Application with Angular.js, Moment.js and Google Maps.

It was necessary to create a single page application with Angular.js. 

The application should have two pages: general table with nearest events and page with the details of event.
All dates and times should be in event's timezone.

I built single page application using Angular.js, Moment.js and Moment-timezone.js. 
Also on the page with detailed information on the event were integrated Google Maps showing the exact venue of the event with a marker.
To facilitate the deployment of the application was created server.js.

To start application you need:

1. Start server by:
node server.js

2. Input in browser address:
localhost:7777

3. Enjoy! :-)
